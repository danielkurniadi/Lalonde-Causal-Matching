    "Overall, assuming that we controlled for all the effects and did it well, it seems that the job training had a positive effect on earnings. Indeed, although the standard deviation is very large, the p value of 0.035 rejects the null hypothesis (no effect) with a confidence level of 97.5%. However, the truth is that we don't know if we modelled the counterfactual well, and this could change everything... As we will see later, estimators such as the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimator can behave poorly when there is not enough covariate overlap, and that's because the estimator needs to extrapolate too much from one group to another.\n",

    "**Improvement -** A more structured approach as we will see later can allow us to increase our confidence that the covariants are well controlled for. We will see many steps, but one simple idea is the technique of matching: the idea is to find for each sample which received the treatment a *similar* sample in the control group, and to directly compare these values."

    "Although, there's a distributional difference in the density plot, but in this case, what we see is that there's overlap everywhere, so this is actually the kind of plot we would like to see if we're going to do propensity score matching. What we mean by overlap is that no matter where we look on the plot, even though there might be more control than treatment or vice versa, there will still be some subject from either group. The notion of overlap means that our positivity assumption is probably reasonable. Remember positivity refers to the situation where all of the subjects in the study have at least some chance of receiving either treatment. And that appears to be the case here, hence this would be a situation where we would feel comfortable to proceed with our propensity score matching."

    "### 6. Matching Estimator\n",
    "\n",
    "Matching is a method that attempts to control for confounding and make an observational study more like a randomized trial. The main idea is to match individuals in the treated group  $A=1 $ to similar individuals in the control group  $A=0$  on the covariates  $X$ . This is similar to the notion of estimating the causal effect of the treatment on the treated.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. Say there is only 1 covariate that we care about, *age*. Then, in a randomized trial, for any particular age, there should be about the same number of treated and untreated people. In the cases where older people are more likely to get  $A=1 $, if we were to match treated people to control people of the same age, there will be about the same number of treated and controls at any age.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data are matched, we can treat it as if it was a randomized trial. The advantage of this approach is that it can help reveal lack of overlap in covariate distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caveat is that we can't exactly match on the full set of covariates, so what we'll do is try and make sure the distribution of covariates is balanced between the groups, also referred to as stochastic balance (The distribution of confounders being similar for treated and untreated subjects)."
